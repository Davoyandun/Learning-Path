# SOLID

## The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. They were introduced by programmer Robert C. Martin in his book "Agile Software Development" in 2003.

The SOLID principles provide guidelines for developing high-quality software that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain. They are based on the concept that software should be designed with constant evolution in mind, not just its current functionality. By following certain principles of design, a system can be created that is scalable, flexible, and easy to modify as business requirements change.

### The SOLID principles are summarized by the acronym SOLID:

```S``` (Single Responsibility Principle): Each class should have a single responsibility within the system.

```O``` (Open-Closed Principle): Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

```L``` (Liskov Substitution Principle): Subclasses should be compatible with their base class in terms of behavior.

```I``` (Interface Segregation Principle): Interfaces should be specific to each client that uses them.

```D``` (Dependency Inversion Principle): Dependencies should be oriented towards abstractions, not concrete implementations.
By following these principles, software can be created that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify. They help minimize the unwanted side effects of code changes, improving the quality of the software and reducing long-term maintenance costs.
